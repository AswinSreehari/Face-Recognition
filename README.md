# 🧠 Face Recognition System (Python + OpenCV + LBPH)

This project is a **real-time facial recognition system** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and the **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram)** algorithm.  
It detects and recognizes faces from **live webcam video** or **static images**, based on a dataset of known individuals.  

The system is lightweight, works **offline**, and can be easily retrained with new faces.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time face detection & recognition via webcam  
- ✅ Recognition from static images  
- ✅ Easy training with your own dataset  
- ✅ Modular architecture (Capture → Train → Recognize)  
- ✅ Works completely offline (no internet required)  
- ✅ Supports multiple image formats (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`)  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Capture Phase** – Capture multiple face images for each person (using webcam).  
2. **Training Phase** – The system extracts facial features using LBPH and trains a model.  
3. **Recognition Phase** – The trained model identifies known faces in real-time through the webcam or static images.
